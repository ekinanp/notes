WHAT IS A VIRTUAL MACHINE?
-It is a software file that behaves like a physical computer, i.e. it contains a display,
a hard disk, one or more processors, memory, and any other hardware that a physical machine
needs. However, all these components are virtualized.

-Elements of a VM are created by software and stored in files across the computer.

-A "host" is what the VM is running on.

THINGS TO DO WITH VMWARE FUSION:
There's a lot of things, but the more interesting uses are:

(1) Run Windows and Linux applications on a Mac

(2) Create VMs

(3) Import VMs

(4) Run multiple VMs

Rest of the doc. is just how to use the software itself, which is not relevant insofar as
high-level details go.
