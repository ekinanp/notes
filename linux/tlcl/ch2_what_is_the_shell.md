Command line = Shell, a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them along to the
OS to carry out.

Note that if the last character of the prompt is a pound sign "#" instead of a dollar sign, the
terminal session has superuser privileges.

Shell maintains a command history of at least the last five hundred commands. You can press the
up arrow key to see the previous command, and the down arrow key to go to the next command.
