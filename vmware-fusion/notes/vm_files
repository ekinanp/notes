VMs are stored on the host computer as a set of files in a directory created by the
Workstation for that specific virtual machine.

The relevant files are contained here:

.log => <vmname>.log or vmware.log

.nvram => <vmname>.nvram or nvram

.vmdk => <vmname>.vmdk (dk = disk)

.vmsd => <vmname>.vmsd (sd = snapshot data)

.vmsn => <vmname>-Snapshot.vmsn or <vmname>-Snapshot<###>.vmsn

.vmss => <vmname>.vmss (ss = snapshot state)

.vmtm => <vmname>.vmtm (vmtm = vm team)

.vmx => <vmname>.vmx (vmx = vm configuration)

.vmxf => <vmname>.vmxf (vmxf = vm team configuration)


EXAMPLES OF EACH FILE:
See the directory example-files to see what actual VMs look like. Note that VMWare Fusion places
VM specific info in:
