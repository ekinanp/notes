This builder starts from an ISO file, creates a brand new VMWare VM, installs an OS,
provisions software within the OS, and then exports that machine to create an image. Best
for those who want to start from scratch.

The result of this VMware builder is a directory containing all the files necessary to
run the virtual machine. Here's an example of the basic configuration:

{
  "type": "vmware-iso",
  "iso_url": "http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/precise/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso",
  "iso_checksum": "af5f788aee1b32c4b2634734309cc9e9",
  "iso_checksum_type": "md5",
  "ssh_username": "packer",
  "ssh_password": "packer",
  "shutdown_command": "shutdown -P now"
}

Note that the above example will not work b/c there is no preseed file for Ubuntu to self-install.
A preseed file provides answers to the questions asked during the installation process without you
having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. It is a way to automate
OS installations.

OBSERVATIONS FROM RUNNING VMWARE-ISO BUILD (EXAMPLE IS IN templates/vmware-iso.json):
(1) Packer will wait until SSH becomes available before doing anything else IF you do not automate
the OS install.

(2) It will locate the relevant VMWare applicaiton on your computer. For me, this is VMWare
Fusion

(3) After a certain period of time, if an SSH connection is not established, Packer will timeout
and fail the build.

(4) If the build fails, Packer will delete all the data used to create the specific VM.

(5) When the build succeeds, Packer will output all the files that make-up that VM, just like
how it would be done if you created it using VMWare. These include the vmx file, vmdk, nvram,
etc.
