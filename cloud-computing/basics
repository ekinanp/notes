WHAT IS IT:
Cloud computing really refers to doing everything you need to do computationally over the
"Internet", where the term "cloud" = "Internet". The term comes from days when the Internet
was represented as a puffy white cloud in flowcharts.

-Provision servers when needed without having to set them up. Expensive to do it at a hardware
level. Cloud computing lets you do these improvements iteratively. Cloud servers do this trick.
When people start visiting, if you need more computing power, you can immediately scale up
to what you need (per-need, on demand basis). If traffic dips down, you can release servers easily.

Three primary models:

(1) Private
Cloud services are provided within the enterprise and behind the org's firewall. Dominated by
IaaS and then PaaS (Platform as a Service)

(2) Public
Cloud services are provided on the Internet for other people to access. Dominated by SaaS
(Software as a Service) and then IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).

(3) Hybrid
There are both private and public services

Virtualization is a big reason that cloud computing is popular -- you can provision VMs on demand/
on need and it will work.

SAAS:
A service that offers on-demand pay-per-use of an application to users. It is platform independent,
and you don't need to install anything on your PC. Examples include Office 365, Google Docs, Wolfram
Alpha, Gmail, etc.

Pros:
-Accessible from any platform
-Can work anywhere
-Good for collaborative working

Cons:
-Portability & Browser issues
-Dependent on Internet performance for overall performance

PAAS:
Mainly a dev. environment, which is a programming language execution environment, OS, web server,
and a database. Users can build, compile, and run their programs without worrying about the
underlying infrastructure. Examples include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Google app
engine, heroku, force.com.

Pros:
-Cost Effective Rapid Dev. (Scalable)
-Faster Market
-Easy deployment of web apps
-Private or public deployment is possible

Cons:
-Devs are limited to the providers' languages and tools
-Migration issues, such as the risk of vendor lock-in

IAAS:
Offers the computing architecture and infrastructure. I.e., offers computing resources in a
virtual environment so that multiple users can access them. Includes data storage, virtualization,
servers & networking. Used mainly by SysAdmins. Examples include Amazon EC2, Rackspace

Pros:
-Cloud provides the infrastructure
-Enhanced scalability -- supports dynamic workloads
-Flexible

Cons:
-Security issues
-Network & Service delays
