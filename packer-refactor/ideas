Here are some of my ideas for refactoring Packer:

(1) The Windows builds adopt the following pattern. If a platform-architecture specific template
does not exist, then it uses the given template in win-common to build the VM. User variables
are in their own file.

For our builds, we could do something like this. For example for Debian, all of the platforms use
the same builder + provisioners. However, it might be cumbersome to have a bunch of debian-common,
ubuntu-common, fedora-common directories.
